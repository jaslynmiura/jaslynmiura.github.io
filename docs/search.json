    "text": "I am a motivated student in the data science field, inspired by my Hawaiʻi community, where the relationship between the land and people fuels my passion to protect the environment I grew up with, using the intersection of technology and tradition/culture.\nGrowing up in Hawaiʻi, Jaslyn was surrounded by a community and unique ecosystems that shaped her love for the environment. Learning about Hawaiian culture that is deeply intertwined with the land while also witnessing the effects of climate change on her home, inspired Jaslyn to work in the environmental science field. Jaslyn intends to return to Hawaiʻi to work alongside her community to apply traditional ecological knowledge and data science to advance sustainable development and conservation."
