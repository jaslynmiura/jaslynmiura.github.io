    "text": "Seafood production in the United States is currently dominated by wild fisheries harvests. Marine aquaculture makes up a small portion of seafood production, however this method of production has been expanding over the past few decades with an approximately 70% increase in marine hectares farmed (Lester et al., 2024). By expanding marine aquaculture, this adds diversity to methods, geographic diversity, and species to seafood production. Diversity within our food systems is vital as it makes it more resilient to disturbances, such as climate change or supply chain failures.\nA first step to understanding where marine aquaculture can continue to expand and be implemented in the United States, is identifying where marine aquaculture farms can be located. Each coastal nation has an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which is an area of the ocean, generally extending 200 nautical miles (230 miles) beyond a nation’s territorial sea, within which a coastal nation has jurisdiction over both living and nonliving resources (NOAA, 2023). Meaning the country has special rights to explore, exploit, and manage marine resources. Therefore, suitable areas for marine aquaculture in the United States can be identified within these Exclusive Economic Zones.\nBy identifying spatial and environmental requirements for aquaculture farms and marine species, we can map the suitable areas where various species can be raised, within in the EEZs.\n\n\nHow can sea surface temperature and ocean depth rasters be used to determine what areas may be suitable to raise different marine aquaculture species?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(paletteer)\nlibrary(maptiles) \nlibrary(testthat)\nlibrary(kableExtra) \nlibrary(knitr)"

    "text": "Data Cleaning\nNOTE: When conducting a spatial analyses, we often want to ensure that our spatial objects have the same coordinate reference systems, resolutions, extents, etc. If statements and unit checks can be written within our code to check these conditions. These “gut checks” were written within the code folds.\nFor this analysis, we’ll be using Sea Surface Temperature rasters from 2008-2012. These rasters were obtained from the NOAA’s 5km Daily Global Satellite Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly v3.1. We’ll first stack the rasters into a single-multilayer raster. We will then calculate the mean sea surface temperature value for each cell across the five years. Therefore, each cell within avg_sst_rast represents the average sea surface temperature from 2008 to 2012 at that location. We’ll also convert the temperature units from Kelvin to Celsius by subtracting 273.15, using raster algebra\n\n\nCode\n# Load in Sea Surface Temperature rasters.\nsst_08 &lt;- rast(here::here('posts', 'eds223-blog-post', 'data', 'average_annual_sst_2008.tif'))\nsst_09 &lt;- rast(here::here('posts', 'eds223-blog-post', 'data', 'average_annual_sst_2009.tif'))\nsst_10 &lt;- rast(here::here('posts', 'eds223-blog-post', 'data', 'average_annual_sst_2010.tif'))\nsst_11 &lt;- rast(here::here('posts', 'eds223-blog-post', 'data', 'average_annual_sst_2011.tif'))\nsst_12 &lt;- rast(here::here('posts', 'eds223-blog-post', 'data', 'average_annual_sst_2012.tif'))\n\n\n\n# Stacking the 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 rasters.\nsst &lt;- c(sst_08, sst_09, sst_10, sst_11, sst_12)\n\n\n# Find the average SST of the stacked layers.\navg_sst_rast &lt;- mean(sst)\n\n\n# Convert the average SST from Kelvin to Celsius, by subtracting 273.15\navg_sst_rast &lt;- avg_sst_rast - 273.15\n\nDepth is another parameter we need for our analysis. This data was obtained from the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO). First, we’ll crop the raster to match the extent of the avg_sst_rast, to ensure that both rasters are within the same study area. We also want to make sure that the resolution of the rasters are the same. So we will resample the cropped depth raster to match the resolution of the avg_sst_rast, using the nearest neighbor method. This method assigns each output cell the value of the closest input cell, therefore the depth value in the depth_resample raster is simply the value from the nearest pixel in the original depth raster.\n\n# Loading the depth raster.\ndepth &lt;- rast(here::here('posts', 'eds223-blog-post', 'data', 'depth.tif'))\n\n\n\nCode\n# Check if coordinate reference systems match.\nif(crs(avg_sst_rast) == crs(depth)) {\n  print(\"CRS of 'avg_sst_rast' and 'depth' match.\")\n} else{\n  warning(\"Updating CRS of 'avg_sst_rast' and 'depth' to match.\")\n  # transform data to match\n  depth &lt;- project(depth, avg_sst_rast)\n}\n\n\nWarning: Updating CRS of 'avg_sst_rast' and 'depth' to match.\n\n\n\n# Cropping the depth raster to match the extent of the SST raster.\ndepth_crop &lt;- terra::crop(depth, avg_sst_rast)\n\n\n# Resampling the depth raster, using the nearest neighbor approach\ndepth_resample &lt;- resample(depth_crop, y = avg_sst_rast, method = \"near\")\n\n\n\nCode\n# Check that the depth_resample and avg_sst_rast match in resolution, extent, and crs.\nif(crs(avg_sst_rast) == crs(depth_resample)) {\n  print(\"CRS of 'avg_sst_rast' and 'depth_resample' match.\")\n} else{\n  warning(\"Updating CRS of 'avg_sst_rast' and 'depth_resample' to match.\")\n  # Transform data to match\n  avg_sst_rast &lt;- project(avg_sst_rast, depth_resample)\n}\n\n\n[1] \"CRS of 'avg_sst_rast' and 'depth_resample' match.\"\n\n\nCode\nif(resolution(avg_sst_rast) == resolution(depth_resample)) {\n  print(\"Resolutions of 'avg_sst_rast' and 'depth_resample' match.\")\n} else{\n  print(\"Resolutions of 'avg_sst_rast' and 'depth_resample' do not match.\")\n}\n\n\n[1] \"Resolutions of 'avg_sst_rast' and 'depth_resample' match.\"\n\n\nCode\nif(ext(avg_sst_rast) == ext(depth_resample)) {\n  print(\"Extents of 'avg_sst_rast' and 'depth_resample' match.\")\n} else{\n  print(\"Extents of 'avg_sst_rast' and 'depth_resample' do not match.\")\n}\n\n\n[1] \"Extents of 'avg_sst_rast' and 'depth_resample' match.\""

    "text": "Spatial Analysis\nFor our analysis, we will be determining suitable areas for oysters. The optimal growing conditions for oysters are sea surface temperatures 11-30°C, and depth of 0-70 meters below sea level.\nWe’ll now reclassify our rasters, given certain temperature and depth parameters, using a reclassification matrix. This is the step within our analysis that identifies the suitable areas for the marine species. Within the temperature matrix we are setting cells that have a sea surface temperature of 11-30 degrees Celsius as 1, and any other values as 0. Within the depth matrix we are setting cells that have a depth of -70-0 meters to 1, and any other values as 0. By reclassifying our rasters, we can then multiple the reclassified rasters to create a new raster, suitable_eez, which only selects the areas where 1x1=1.\n\n\nCode\n# Reclassify avg_sst_rast into locations that are suitable for oysters.\nrcl_temp &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, 11, 0,\n                11, 30, 1,\n                30, Inf, 0),\n              ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n\nreclassified_sst &lt;- classify(avg_sst_rast, rcl = rcl_temp)\n\nreclassified_sst[is.na(reclassified_sst)] &lt;- 0\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Reclassify depth into locations that are suitable for oysters.\nrcl_depth &lt;- matrix(c(-Inf, -70, 0,\n                -70, 0, 1,\n                0, Inf, 0),\n              ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\n\nreclassified_depth &lt;- classify(depth_resample, rcl = rcl_depth)\n\nreclassified_depth[is.na(reclassified_depth)] &lt;- 0\n\n\n\n# Multiply depth and temperature rasters to find suitable areas for both conditions.\nsuitable_eez &lt;- (reclassified_depth)*(reclassified_sst)\n\n\nDetermine the most suitable EEZ\nThe reclassification step resulted in a raster that identifies suitable areas with 0’s and 1’s, across a large portion of the West Coast and Pacific Ocean.

According to our map, the Washington region appears to have the largest suitable area for Red Abalone to be raised, in comparison to the other EEZ regions. From looking at the exact suitable area (km\\(^2\\)) within each EEZ region, the areas are fairly low, being within the 0-1000 square kilometers. This suggests that marine aquaculture farms raising Red Abalone would be restricted to the limited suitable areas. Therefore, it may be more economically feasible and efficient to consider raising other species that have a broader and larger suitable area, within each EEZ along the West Coast."

    "text": "Due to changing climate conditions, macroalgae coverage can impact the transitional phases in coral colonization. Because coral reefs play such a vital role in ecosystem services, understanding coral reef dynamics is important. One component of this is understanding how the macroalgae within these systems are being controlled. The herbivorous fishes Chlorurus sordidus, commonly known as parrot fish, and Ctenochaetus striatus, commonly known as striated surgeonfish, are essential reef fish species that feed directly on algae, therefore influencing the health of coral reefs.\nObservation data was collected from coral reefs around Moʻorea, French Polynesia, at research stations LTER 1 and Resilience 2. Focal fish species were identified by a SCUBA diver, an estimated fish length (cm), the depth at the start and end of the observation period, substrate types, and the number of bites taken within 5 minutes was recorded. The data was collected over several days in July and August of 2010 between the times of 10:00 and 16:00, an identified period of time which corresponds to peak feeding rates for many herbivorous fishes (Adam, 2019).\nUsing this data, we want to understand how herbivore grazing bite counts are influenced by fish size, species, depth, and substrate.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(MASS)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Load in the data.\ndata1 &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"posts\", \n                             \"eds222-blog-post\",\n                             \"data\", \n                             \"MCR_LTER_HerbBite_Focal_Herb_Bite_Rates_2010_20120521.csv\")) %&gt;% \n  clean_names() %&gt;%\n  dplyr::select(-c(time_period, depth_cat))\n\ndata2 &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"posts\", \n                             \"eds222-blog-post\",\n                             \"data\", \n                             \"MCR_LTER_HerbBite_Addit_Bite_Rate_Data_2010_20120521.csv\")) %&gt;% \n  clean_names()\n\n# Stacking the datasets and dropping unnecessary columns.\nbite_data &lt;- rbind(data1, data2) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(-c(\"observer\", \"time_beg\", \"time_end\", \"stage\", \"notes\")) %&gt;% \n  drop_na()\n\n# Creating a mean_depth column.\nbite_data$mean_depth &lt;- (bite_data$depth_beg + bite_data$dept_end) / 2\n\n# Dropping the depth range columns.\nbite_data &lt;- bite_data %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(-c(\"depth_beg\", \"dept_end\"))\n\n# Of the substrate type create a column of the dominant substrate.\nbite_data$dominant_substrate &lt;- apply(\n  bite_data[, c(\"bare\", \"rubble\", \"cca\", \"sand\", \"other\")],\n  1,\n  function(x) names(x)[which.max(x)])\n\n# Drop individual substrate columns make species and substrates factors.\nbite_data_clean &lt;- bite_data %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(-c(\"bare\", \"rubble\", \"cca\", \"sand\", \"other\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(species = factor(species),\n         dominant_substrate = factor(dominant_substrate))\n\n\nThe data source provides two datasets that hold observational dat from different dates and locations in Moʻorea. After stacking the dataframes, columns that were not required for the analysis were dropped. Some cleaning of our variables was also conducted. A mean_depth column was created, which is the average depth during each observation. This was created by taking the average depth between the recorded depth at the start and end of the observation. A dominant_substrate column was also created, which represents the substrate that was bitten the most of all the possible substrates. This was done by detecting which substrate had the highest number of bites for each observed fish.\n\n\n\nWe’ll begin with basic data exploration by plotting fish body length (cm) and depth (ft) against the total bite count to visualize any potential relationships between these variables and our response variable, total number of bites. We also want to know the shape of the total bite count distribution to help determine what statistical model we should use for our analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot of size vs. total bites, by species.\nggplot(data = bite_data_clean, aes(x = size_cm, y = total_bites, color = species)) +\n  geom_jitter() +\n  labs(x = \"Body Length (cm)\",\n       y = \"Total Number of Bites\",\n       color = \"Species\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"dodgerblue\", \"violet\"),\n                     labels = c(\"Chlorurus sordidus (Parrotfish)\", \n                                \"Ctenochaetus striatus (Striated surgeonfish)\")) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Total number of bites as a result of body length (cm), by species, across 164 observed fish.

This means that substrate does not statistically influence expected bite counts.\n\nIn summary, bite count decreases when fish length increases, suggesting that larger fish take fewer bites, which can be explained by the idea of larger fish taking less bites, due to taking bigger bites. Bite counts also significantly increase as depth increases. This can indicate more food availability at different depth levels."

By doing so, we should be able to visualize the size effect within our predicted expected values.\nFor both parrotfish and striated surgeonfish, the predicted expected bite count slope curves downward as size increases.

Therefore, when depth is 0, we’d expect striated surgeonfish to have lower expected bite rated than parrotfish. However, this effect could be considered not statistically significant as it’s p-value is 0.055.\nThe depth effect on parrot fish, is not significant. Meaning that depth does not affect the expected bite count of parrotfish.\nThe dominant substrate effect is again not significant. Therefore, when holding all other variables constant, substrate does not affect the expected bite count.\nThe interaction between species and depth effect, represents the differing bite rates between parrotfish and striated surgeonfish because of depth effect. The interaction has a positive, statistically significant effect, indicating that striated surgeon fish experience a stronger increase in expected bite rates with increasing depth, compared to parrotfish (reference species).\n\nIn summary, this new additive-interaction Negative Binomial Regression model indicates that again larger fish take less bites. Within this new model an important effect is that at deeper depths, there is a stronger increase in the expected bite counts of striated surgeon fish compared to parrotfish. Therefore, the model reveals different behaviors and patterns within species related to herbivory grazing upon coral reefs."

Predictions generated from varying depth and keeping all other variables constant and using the additive-interactive Negative Binomial Regression model.\n\n\n\n\nThe figure displays the relationship between the depth (ft) and total bite counts for parrotfish and striated surgeonfish, overlaid with predicted expected bite counts generated from the additive-interactive Negative Binomial Regression model. The 95% confidence interval is represented as the shaded grey region.\nConnecting Coefficient Estimates to Predicted Bite Rates:\nRecall our species x depth interaction effect coefficient interpretation: “The interaction between species and depth effect represents the differing bite rates between parrotfish and striated surgeonfish because of the depth effect. The interaction has a positive, statistically significant effect, indicating that striated surgeon fish experience a stronger increase in expected bite rates with increasing depth, compared to parrotfish (reference species).”\nWhen generating predictions of expected bite counts, we varied our depth variable and held all the other predictor variables constant. By doing so, we should be able to visualize the interaction between species and depth effect within our predicted expected values.\nFor both parrotfish and striated surgeonfish, the predicted expected bite counts slope curves upward as depth increases. However, as depth increases, the upward curve of the slope is steeper for striated surgeon fish. Indicating that striated surgeon fish experience a stronger increase in expected bite rates with increasing depth, compared to parrotfish. This aligns with the statistically significant positive coefficient for the depth and species interaction effect in the additive-interactive model."
