Using the same LiDAR dataset, but a different combination of bands allows us to create different types of map images. A true color image; which is probably what you're used to seeing. And a false color image; which will highlight the fire scars.\n\nWe'll then explore where different levels of socioeconomic factors were present within the fire perimeters. The factors we are interested in are the percentage of persons who are unemployed, percentile rank of the percentage of persons who are uninsured, percentile rank of the percentage of persons aged 65 and older. This will be completed by wrangling the Environmental Justice Index data.\n\n### Datasets:\n\nEaton Fire Perimeter: Accessed from the County of Los Angeles Geohub.
